## CREDITS

**BIG** Thanks to Sean Huggins, here's his [article](https://medium.com/@seanhugg/chatrpg-a-text-adventure-game-with-an-inventory-and-health-system-using-chatgpt-d49d0969931c) he did the original prompt so I decided to do a version based off it, USING it, so thank you A LOT!!!

# Chat-RPG

Welcome to Chat-RPG, a text adventure RPG game prompt designed to use with Chat GPT (but should work in other ones too!).

This does **not** bypass/jailbreak anything. But if you want, you can try it inside a Local LLM (Large Language Model).

## Tips

- Didn't like the alternatives the AI gave you? just type in what your character will do.
- You can change the prompt to your liking... maybe give you some coins? make your character OP, I know some of you might wanna do that.
- After pasting the prompt you can tell the AI a little about your character... but to avoid the AI forgetting something, don't write an entire wikipedia page... or write, this is your adventure.

  Adding more later, you can give some of your tips too.

## Features

- **Health System**

- **Level Progression**

- **Inventory System**

- **Stats System**

More will be added, feel free to contribute or request anything, I will do my best.

## How do I use this?

Copy the prompt you want and in a new session/chat, just paste it there.
